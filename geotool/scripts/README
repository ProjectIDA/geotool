This directory contains example geotool scripts. There are several methods
to execute the scripts.

Graphical, Interactive:
	geotool parse=fbands
or
	geotool
	geotool> parse fbands
	geotool> more commands
	...

Non-graphical, Non-interactive: This method does not display the graphics. To
make the program exit after the script is interpreted, append the "quit"
command to the script file.

	geotool -i << fbands

Non-graphical, Interactive: This method does not display the graphics, but
continues to accept input commands from the terminal. After the commands in
the script are executed, the "geotool>" is displayed and commands are
interpreted from the terminal until a "quit" command is input.

	geotool -i parse=fbands
or
	geotool -i
	geotool> parse fbands
	geotool> more commands
	...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All script files in the subdirectory init/ are automatically interpreted each
time geotool is executed.
