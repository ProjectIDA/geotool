Amplitude Help={text, 
To review an amplitude measurement, select one or more rows from the
amplitude record table and then click the Review button. The corresponding
waveforms will be displayed in the graph below the table.  If the amplitude
measurement was made from a beam, then that beam will be displayed.

An amplitude-period box will be displayed at the time of the amplitude
measurement. The amplitude-period box can be stretched horizontally and/or
vertical to adjust the amplitude and period measurement. The box can be moved
to adjust the start_time by dragging the center vertical line.

The Cancel button or the Close button will cancel any adjustments to the
amplitude-period box. The Save button will save all adjustments to the
corresponding amplitude file.}

Arrival Parameters Help={text, }

Amplitude Parameters Help={text,
threshold2:
    Try to identify a peak/trough backwards and a peak/trough forwards,
    if any more are in the window. Test whether the peaks have substantial
    amplitude compared to the central peak/trough pair.
    Must have:
        (peak or trough amp) > (threshold2 / 100.0) * maxamp

threshold3:
    Percentage of (0.0 to Nyquist frequency) band used by the digitizer.

    min_half_period_threshold = 1.0 / (amp_threshold3 / 100.0)
    max_half_period_threshold = ((float)nsamples_in_window - 5.0) / 5.0

    Must have:
        max_half_period_threshold > min_half_period_threshold &&
        max_half_period_threshold >= 1.0 / (locut_freq_amp / allowed_lp_ratio)

threshold4:
    Maximum ratio between found half periods allowed before the hypothesis
    of missed peak/trough pair prevails and interefrence effects may be seen.

    If the max_half_period/min_half_period ratio is greater than threshold4
    then expect that max_half_period may be wrong, e.g. some peak/trough pair
    was deleted and now max_half_period is overestimating the true value;
    interference effects may play also important role ...  To select the one
    which might be used as a reference, compare which one is more out from the
    selected filter band. If both are within the band then delete the larger one.

threshold5:
    The maximum allowed mean value of the signal in the window compared
    to the found peak-trough difference Maxamp, expressed in percent.
    fabs(signal_mean) / Maxamp must be <  threshold5/100.

threshold6:
    For signals which have several similar amplitude swings, it may mean
    that the peak_to_trough_amplitude found is somewhere close to the end
    of the window. In such a case, there might be a very similar amplitude
    just around the pick that is only slighty smaller.  To avoid this,
    select the first peak-trough pair closes from the beginning of window
    whose amplitude is greater than threshold6 % of the maximum amplitude.

When data is read from flat files, there are three settings that control which
origin records are input along with the waveforms and listed in the Origins
window.

Load Origins within Time Limits:
    Load all origins whose times satisfies:
        waveform_beginning - 4 hours < origin_time < waveform_end

Load Associated Origin Only:
    Load only origins that are associated through Assoc records to Arrivals that
    are displayed on the waveforms.

Arrivals Help={text,
To add an arrival, select from the phase list, position
the phase line, select the waveforms and activate the Add
button. Selected waveforms can be aligned at the phase
line with the Align button. An Arrival can be deleted by
selecting the arrival with a left mouse button click on
the arrival label and then activating the Delete button.
An amplitude/phase measurement can be made with a
right-button click on the waveform cycle. Any side of the
measuring box can be stretched by positioning the cursor
just inside the box and doing a right mouse button drag.

Measure Amp Per Help={text,
To add an amplitude and period, move the mouse cursor near
the waveform, and press the right mouse button while
pressing the shift key.  This will draw the Amplitude and
Period box on the waveform.

Size the measurement box with a the left mouse button drag near
the sides of the box. The box can be translated with a left mouse
button drag near the vertical line in the middle of the box.}

Instrument Response Help={text,
Instrument records for all waveforms are listed in the Instruments table.
Select an Instrument record with the left mouse button to display all the
responses for that instrument. Select in the Responses table to plot the
response(s).

Instrument responses can be deconvolved and convolved with the waveforms.
Under the Option menu, there are Convolve and Deconvolve menus. Each has a
sub-menu with Replace and Add. Select replace to replace all convolution
operators with the current operation (convolution or deconvolution). Select
Add to append the current operation to any existing convolution operators.
All convolution operators are applied before any other operation, such as
filtering, cutting, etc. (See the Processing History table. Main-window/
Option/History.)

The Return To Original option removes all convolution and deconvolution
operators.}

Response Tapers Help={text,
In the Data Taper field enter the length of a cosine taper that will be
applied to both ends of the waveform before the convolution or deconvolution
operator is applied. After the convolution/deconvolution operation, the
amplitude spectrum will be tapered with a cosine taper from zero frequency
to the Low Pass setting and from the High Pass setting to nyquist. Enter
0.0 in the Low Pass and/or High Pass fields to turn off amplitude tapering.}
